## Featured Projects
- **fintech-backend** - The project follows a layered architecture to promote separation of concerns and modularity. Primary technologies include Go, PostgreSQL, Docker and Swagger. Application is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment.
- **pasteeclipboard** — Pastee Clipboard is a lightweight clipboard manager that lives in your system tray, allowing you to monitor and reuse your clipboard history with ease. Designed with productivity in mind.  
- **FileUploadApi** — A simple file upload API built with .NET 8, following Clean Architecture principles. The API allows users to register, upload and manage photos, with file storage simulated using AWS S3 (LocalStack) and persistence with SQL Server running in Docker.
- **payment-platform** — This project is an online payment platform that enables merchants to process payments, retrieve payment details, and process refunds via a simple API. The platform is built using Go and the Echo framework, with PostgreSQL, and Wiremock for simulating external payment gateways.
